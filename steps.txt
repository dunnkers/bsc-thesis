Step 1
- Predict flower type
- (Train a model): split data; use half to train and one half to predict
- 
- Use k-nearest neighbours, then SVM / decision tree(random forest)/ neural network /
- Sklearn / any other library


Step 2
â€¦ using image pixels
2 values as a feature vector
- Using a dataset of 2 classes
- e.g. Classify cats and dogs
- Converting images to features vectors
- Converting the 2d matrix 
- Downsample the image
